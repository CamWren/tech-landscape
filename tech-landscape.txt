	Why I'm interested:
		I'm looking for opportunities that involve testing and debugging code in addition to writing new code.
		I'm a problem solver and I love finding out how things work. I feel that having an entry-level job 
		that focuses on testing and debugging will give me the opportunity to see the best practices of coding 
		websites and applications first hand. Also I feel testing and debugging will give me the ability to 
		further acquaint myself with several languages. The job posting above has an ideal mix of creating code 
		using best practices but also digging into already established code to find bugs or optimize the code.

	Why I'm interested:
		This opportunity involves a bit of digital marketing which is something I majored in at UT Austin.
		I like the idea of combining two different degree backgrounds into one job. This opportunity also
		affords the chance to dive into back-end development with maintaining established databases which 
		is something I am not only interested in learning more about but I feel would make me a well-rounded
		developer. Another thing about this opportunity that resonates with me is the chance to peek into the 
		world of cyber-security. Lastly, there are chances to work with third parties such as web hosting, outside 
		web development/design agencies, and online banking partners. This would give me a macro overview of the
		entire ecosystem of teams and individuals it takes to execute buiding web and mobile apps specifically 
		for clients.
